# Sudoku Solver in C++

This is a C++ implementation of a Sudoku solver that uses backtracking to solve 9x9 Sudoku puzzles. It includes functionalities to validate inputs, check safe placements, and print the Sudoku grid.

---

## Features

- **Backtracking Algorithm**: Efficiently solves Sudoku puzzles.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures the initial grid follows Sudoku rules.
- **Grid Printing**: Displays the Sudoku grid in a readable format.
- **Customizable**: Supports any 9x9 Sudoku puzzle as input.

---

## How It Works

1. **Input Validation**: 
   - The program checks rows, columns, and 3x3 subgrids for duplicates.
   - Ensures the input grid adheres to Sudoku rules.

2. **Backtracking**:
   - The algorithm tries placing numbers (1â€“9) in each empty cell.
   - Recursively checks if the placement is valid.
   - If a placement leads to a dead end, it backtracks and tries the next possible number.

3. **Grid Printing**:
   - The grid is printed with separators for better visualization.

## Code Structure

- **`isSafe`**: Checks if placing a number in a cell is valid.
- **`isValidInput`**: Validates the initial Sudoku grid.
- **`solveSudoku`**: Solves the Sudoku puzzle using backtracking.
- **`print`**: Prints the Sudoku grid in a formatted manner.

---

## Usage

1. **Include the Code**:
   Copy and paste the code into your C++ project.

2. **Input the Sudoku Grid**:
   - Replace `mat[n][n]` with your Sudoku puzzle.
   - Use `0` for empty cells.

3. **Compile and Run**:
   ```bash
   g++ sudoku_solver.cpp -o sudoku_solver
   ./sudoku_solver
